# VPN-in-Azure
This lab demonstrates how VPNs can alter perceived geolocation and mask public IP addresses by deploying and interacting with a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure. The objective is to understand how VPNs route internet traffic through remote servers and how this affects internet behavior and content localization.
